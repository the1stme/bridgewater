# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing Banking application from Supabase to Convex as the backend database and real-time platform. The migration must maintain full type safety, preserve all existing functionality, and ensure zero data loss while providing improved developer experience and real-time capabilities. The migration will be performed incrementally with Git version control throughout the process to allow rollback at any stage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Supabase to Convex with full type safety, so that I can benefit from Convex's real-time capabilities and improved developer experience while maintaining all existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use Convex as the primary database instead of Supabase
2. WHEN any database operation is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain full TypeScript type safety throughout the stack
3. WHEN the migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL use Git version control to track all changes and allow rollback
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work identically to the Supabase implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be completely transparent to end users, so that users experience no disruption and are unaware that any backend changes occurred.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN users SHALL continue using the application without any knowledge of backend changes
2. WHEN users access their accounts THEN all account balances, transaction history, and transfer records SHALL be preserved exactly as before
3. WHEN users perform transactions or transfers THEN the system SHALL maintain identical business logic and user experience
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the UI SHALL require no changes and users SHALL notice no difference in functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage Convex's real-time capabilities, so that the application can provide live updates for account balances and transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN account balances change THEN the UI SHALL update in real-time without manual refresh
2. WHEN new transactions are added THEN they SHALL appear immediately in the transaction list
3. WHEN transfers are processed THEN both source and destination accounts SHALL show updates simultaneously
4. WHEN multiple users access the same data THEN all users SHALL see consistent real-time updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing database schema structure in Convex, so that minimal code changes are required in the frontend components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining Convex schema THEN it SHALL mirror the existing Supabase table structure
2. WHEN accessing data THEN the same field names and data types SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN performing queries THEN the API interface SHALL remain as similar as possible to the current implementation
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN existing React components SHALL require minimal modifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper error handling and validation in Convex, so that the application maintains robust data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN Convex validators SHALL reject the operation with clear error messages
2. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL prevent data corruption
3. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions appropriately
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly typed and handled in the frontend

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement secure authentication with Convex, so that user data remains protected during and after the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL use Convex Auth or a secure authentication pattern
2. WHEN accessing protected resources THEN proper authorization checks SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN admin users access admin functions THEN role-based access control SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN users SHALL be prompted to re-authenticate gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement comprehensive testing for the Convex migration, so that I can ensure data integrity and functionality before going live.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL cover all Convex functions
2. WHEN testing data operations THEN integration tests SHALL verify end-to-end functionality
3. WHEN comparing implementations THEN tests SHALL validate that Convex behavior matches Supabase behavior
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL pass with the new Convex implementation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper data migration utilities, so that existing Supabase data can be transferred to Convex safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating data THEN a migration script SHALL transfer all existing records from Supabase to Convex
2. WHEN data is migrated THEN all relationships and foreign key constraints SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN migration runs THEN data integrity checks SHALL verify successful transfer
4. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities
